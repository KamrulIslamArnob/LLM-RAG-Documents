Q3: How will you commercialise your product and generate revenue?
Discuss how you plan to turn your idea into a product or service. Include details on

MediTouch aims to commercialise its telemedicine platform through a structured approach that addresses market needs, revenue generation, and scalability. Here’s a concise overview of the strategy:

Potential Markets: 

Rural Areas: With over 100 million rural inhabitants in Bangladesh facing significant healthcare access challenges, this market is ripe for telemedicine solutions. Research indicates that 86% of rural residents view telemedicine as cost-effective, making it an attractive option for underserved populations.

Low- and Middle-Income Urban Areas: Urban users will benefit from a freemium model, providing basic services for free while offering premium features at 400-800 BDT/month. This strategy captures a broad user base while generating revenue from those seeking advanced services.

Revenue Models:

MediTouch's revenue model is designed to maximise benefits for users while ensuring profitability. The platform targets both urban and rural markets, recognising the unique needs of each demographic. For urban users, MediTouch offers a freemium model, providing basic services at no cost while allowing access to premium features for a monthly fee.   This approach encourages widespread adoption and generates revenue from those seeking enhanced services. In rural areas, the platform provides agent-assisted plans at an affordable price, ensuring that low-income populations can access essential healthcare services without financial strain.

Transaction fees represent another significant revenue stream. MediTouch will charge a commission on e-pharmacy sales and diagnostic bookings, creating a steady income while facilitating convenient access to medications and health assessments for users. Partnerships with local pharmacies and diagnostic centres will further enhance revenue potential, as these entities will subscribe to the platform for tools that streamline patient management and prescription services.

Additionally, MediTouch will earn commissions on insurance policies sold through the app, diversifying its revenue sources and promoting health insurance literacy among users. To attract both users and partners, MediTouch will emphasise the affordability and convenience of its services, highlighting the time and cost savings associated with telemedicine.

Our venture aims to revolutionise healthcare access in rural areas through a tech-driven platform and strategic partnerships. We are creating an app that enables even illiterate users to receive medical prescriptions at an affordable cost. The core of our commercialisation strategy is collaboration with local pharmacists, who will serve as distribution points. By partnering with pharmaceutical companies, we ensure a fast and efficient supply chain for necessary and hard-to-find medicines, delivering them to both pharmacists and patients' homes. Additionally, we will generate revenue through small commissions from doctor visits facilitated through the platform and from medical tests recommended to users to several diagnostic centres. This scalable model addresses healthcare access challenges while ensuring strong commercial returns.


To ensure scalability, MediTouch plans grassroots campaigns to educate communities about the app’s benefits, alongside collaborations with government health initiatives to integrate into public health frameworks. By focusing on affordability, convenience, and strategic partnerships, MediTouch aims to create a sustainable business model that transforms healthcare delivery in Bangladesh while ensuring profitability.


Scaling Strategies:

Grassroots Campaigns: Promote MediTouch through local outreach initiatives to educate communities about the app's benefits and functionalities.
Government Collaborations: Partner with government health initiatives to facilitate rapid scaling and integration into public health frameworks, enhancing credibility and reach.
Expanding Service Offerings: As the platform grows, introduce features like real-time health monitoring through wearable technology and enhanced mental health support services.
